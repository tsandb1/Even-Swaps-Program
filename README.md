# Even Swaps Program
A program based on the Even Swaps method by Hammond et al. (1998)

The following are the rules for using the even swaps program:

1. You are asked to input your username and password
1a. If new user, you will input what you want your username and password to be
1b. Then, the rules for conducting even swaps are displayed for you and you will go through an even swaps example
1c. If returning user, you will be asked whether you would like to create a consequences table (CT) and ranking table (RT)
or if you would like to load a CT or RT from a file (Excel file)
2. You are asked to create an RT if you created a CT in the program or if you loaded a CT from a file
3. Once in RT format, the program checks for equal attributes and removes these and checks for dominance 
removing any dominated alternative
4. The program asks whether you would like to make an even swap and displays whether an alternative is likely 
to dominate another, and displays the objective ranks that are almost equal such that it is easier to see what
objectives and alternatives you should make swaps on
